# Machine learning methods
The aim here is to classify which sEMG signals correspond to vehicle braking so as to build a human-machine interface using these signals.

I tried with k-NN, LSTM and some initial attempts to use reinforcement learning (RL). RL with a normal network does not work as the network's structure is not suited for time-series data. I made a first attempt to use RL combined with a LSTM network (in progress). I will get back when I have time.
