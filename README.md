# Research internship: Automotive control using surface electromyography
My work during the research internship "Automotive Control Using Surface Electromyography" at The University of Tokyo (UTokyo/Todai), June-September 2020.

It concerns a human-machine interface for vehicle driving assistance using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The two main tasks are signal processing and signal classification using machine learning. The project report is found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348182394_Automotive_Control_using_Surface_Electromyography).

This research work resulted in the following conference paper:

**Gia Quoc Bao Tran**, Zheng Wang, Yusuke Koge, Kimihiko Nakano. Surface Electromyography-controlled Vehicle Braking Assistance System Using Deep Learning. 12th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics, New York, USA, July 2021.

More updates will be added.
