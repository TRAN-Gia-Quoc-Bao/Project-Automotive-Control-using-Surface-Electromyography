# Research internship: Automotive control using surface electromyography
My work during the research internship "Automotive Control using Surface Electromyography" at The University of Tokyo (UTokyo/Todai), June-September 2020.

It concerns a human-machine interface for vehicle driving assistance using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The two main tasks are signal processing and signal classification using machine learning.

This research work has been accepted to [AHFE 2021](http://2021.ahfe.org/) in New York, USA.

More updates will be added.
