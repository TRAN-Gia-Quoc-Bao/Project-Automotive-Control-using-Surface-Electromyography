# Research internship: Automotive control using surface electromyography
My work during the research internship "Automotive Control using Surface Electromyography" at The University of Tokyo (UTokyo/Todai), June-September 2020.

It concerns a human-machine interface for vehicle driving assistance using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The two main tasks are signal processing and signal classification using machine learning.

This research work resulted in a paper accepted to the international conference [AHFE 2021](http://2021.ahfe.org/) in New York, USA. The preprint will soon be uploaded on [my ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gia_Quoc_Bao_Tran).

More updates will be added.
