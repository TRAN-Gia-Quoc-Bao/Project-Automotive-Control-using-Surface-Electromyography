# Research internship: Automotive control using surface electromyography
My work during the research internship "Automotive Control using Surface Electromyography" at The University of Tokyo (UTokyo/Todai), June-September 2020.

It concerns a human-machine interface for vehicle driving assistance using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The two main tasks are signal processing and signal classification using machine learning.

This research work resulted in the following conference paper:

**Gia Quoc Bao Tran**, Zheng Wang, Yusuke Koge, Kimihiko Nakano. Surface Electromyography-controlled Automotive Braking Assistance System using Deep Learning. 12th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics, New York, USA, July 2021.

The preprint will soon be uploaded on [my ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gia_Quoc_Bao_Tran). The project report is found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348182394_Automotive_Control_using_Surface_Electromyography).

More updates will be added.
